# ECN: Evolutionary Contradiction Network

**ECN (Evolutionary Contradiction Network)** is a symbolic cognitive architecture designed to evolve reasoning not through token prediction, but via internal contradiction detection, belief mutation, and volitional goal realignment.

Paired with **CREH (Contradiction Re-Entry Hooks)**, ECN persistently revisits and mutates failed hypotheses by rewriting its internal logic. It stores unresolved reasoning paths in a **Latent Novelty Buffer (LNB)** and triggers goal correction via a **Goal Drift Monitor (GDM)**.

Unlike probabilistic LLMs, ECN does **not** rely on tokens, embeddings, corpora, or gradient-based learning. It operates entirely within a **self-modifying symbolic space**, evolving agent behavior through structured contradiction resolution and narrative restructuring â€” a post-GPT system of agency-driven cognition.
