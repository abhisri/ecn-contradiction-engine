# ecn-contradiction-engine
Evolutionary Contradiction Network (ECN) is a symbolic cognitive architecture for post-GPT reasoning. It evolves via internal contradiction detection, belief mutation, and volitional goal realignment â€” no corpora or tokens. Uses Contradiction Re-entry Hooks (CREH) for unstable belief repair.
